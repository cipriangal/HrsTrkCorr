This contains a simple example of how to use HrsTrkCorr in
a compiled code like a Monte Carlo.

You can type "make" to compile the executible "xtest", then
run xtest by typing

          ./xtest

libtrkcorr.so  is found from $DIR_TRKCORR in the Makefile
Likewise, this points to the header HrsTrkCorr.h

trktest_main.C  -- the main code
xtest  -- the executible

holefiles is a directory with the "hole files" and the
"residuals" that are required for running HrsTrkCorr.
Generally it would be in ../holefiles relative to where
you are now, so do this (or the equivalent if you put
holefiles somewhere else).

   ln -s ../holefiles holefiles
